<h1>UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA<br />
LIBRARY HANDBOOK<br />
1918-1919</h1>

<hr />

<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>This handbook has been prepared chiefly for
the convenience of students and members of the
faculty, but it may also be of interest to university
and college librarians and their assistants.
It is a directory of the University Library, intended
to facilitate the use of the books by indicating
their location and arrangement and describing
the aids by which easiest access to them
may be obtained. The regulations necessary to
safeguard their use are appended.</p>

<p>This handbook was approved for printing on
April 15, 1918, by the Library Committee.</p>

<h2>HISTORICAL SKETCH</h2>

<p>The University Library had its origin in the
small collection of books that belonged to the College
of California. In 1868 the College transferred
its library numbering 1036 volumes to the
University. Five years later, the collection was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
moved from Oakland to Berkeley and was located
in the north end of South Hall. These quarters
soon became too small and in 1876 Henry Douglass
Bacon gave $25,000 toward the erection of a separate
library building. The State of California
in 1878 added an equal amount to this gift and in
1881 the Bacon Library was completed.</p>

<p>The bequest in 1904 by Charles Franklin Doe
of twenty-four per cent of his estate made available
approximately $750,000 for the present library
building. In 1911 a little more than half the
building was completed, and in May of that year
the collection was moved from the Bacon Library
to the new building. A state bond issue made
possible its completion in 1917.</p>

<p>The University Library now numbers 375,000
volumes, the average annual increase for the last
five years being about 25,000 volumes. This
growth has been made possible by a University
book appropriation, supplemented by special funds,
in particular, the Michael Reese fund, available
for purchases in any field, the Jane K. Sather
funds for classics, history, and law, the Ernst A.
Denicke fund for German philology, and the
Eugene Meyer, Jr., fund for history.</p>

<p>Valuable gifts of books in special fields have
also been made, such as the many contributions
of Mr. J. C. Cebrian in Spanish literature, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
the donations of Louis Sloss, Jacob Voorsanger,
and Alfred Greenebaum toward a Semitic collection.</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION OF LIBRARY BUILDING</h2>

<p>The building is in the classic style of architecture
and was designed by John Galen Howard.
It is a steel frame, fireproof structure of the
highest class, with outside dimensions of 262 feet
by 224 feet. The exterior is of California granite
with roof of red mission tile. The total cost including
furnishing was $1,200,000.</p>

<p>It is rectangular in form, the covered central
court, slightly over 100 feet square, being reserved
for book storage, in two nine-story stacks of a
combined capacity of one million volumes. At
present only one of these stacks has been installed.
The main entrance is from the north.
To the left of the vestibule is the Bancroft Library,
a collection under separate administration devoted
to the history of California and the Southwest.
To the right is the Reserved Book Room where
are shelved those books designated by instructors
as class references for the current semester.
The remainder of the ground floor is given up to
seminars 110 to 132.</p>

<p>The main stairway leads directly to the Delivery
Hall where is the Loan Desk, with the entrance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
to the stack directly behind it. Opposite
the Loan Desk, facing north, is the Reading Room,
210 feet long and 53 feet wide, with a seating
capacity of five hundred and shelf room for about
twenty thousand volumes. In it will be found all
reference books except indexes, and in addition
a fairly representative collection of general literature.
At the east end of the Delivery Hall is the
Reference Room through which access to the new
Periodical Room is obtained. This latter, 135 feet
long by 45 feet wide, extends down the east side
of the main floor and provides seats for 240 readers
and shelf room for the current magazines in
most general use. The administration rooms occupy
the corresponding position on the western
side of this floor, the Associate Librarian’s Office
and the Accessions Department, with a common
entrance from the Delivery Hall, the Librarian’s
Office and the Catalogue Room opening on the west
corridor. Two rooms for the use of the library
staff, three for instruction in library science, and
one for binding preparation and for supplies extend
across the south. The Union Card Catalogue
will be found in the corridor leading to these.</p>

<p>On the third floor, reached by the western
staircase and by the elevator, are the Library of
French Thought (room 303), seminars 307 to 317,
the map room (318), and a room (320) holding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
books not suitable for shelving in the regular
stack. On the fourth floor are rooms 405 to 438,
the majority used as private studies for members
of the faculty, but a few of them combination
seminar rooms and offices.</p>

<p>There are also basements on the south and
west sides, the former used by the University
Press as a storage room, the latter, furnished
with a freight entrance and a staff elevator, being
the library receiving and unpacking room. From
the rear of the building between these is a public
entrance. This by means of a corridor and stairway,
enables readers from the south to reach the
ground floor.</p>

<h2>CLASSIFICATION</h2>

<p>The books in the Library are at present arranged
according to two systems:</p>

<p>1. <b>The Library of Congress classification</b>, slightly
modified. It is expected that the entire library
will ultimately be reclassified by this system.
Letters are used for main classes, subdivisions are
chiefly indicated by numbers. The subjects now
included in this classification are:</p>

<table summary="Library of Congress classification" class="narrow">
  <tr>
    <td>CJ</td><td>Numismatics</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>CR</td><td>Heraldry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>D</td><td>History and topography, except America (in progress)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>E</td><td>American history</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td><td><span class="ditto">”</span> <span class="ditto">”</span> (local)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>G</td><td>Geography, Anthropology, Folk-lore, Manners and customs, Sports and games</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>H</td><td>Social sciences</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>J</td><td>Political sciences</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>L</td><td>Education</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>2. <b>The Rowell classification</b> which covers all
subjects not reclassified. In it instead of letters,
the classes are indicated by numbers from 1 to
999 with some sub-classes given lower case letters
following these. A brief table of important main
classes follows.</p>

<table summary="Rowell classification" class="narrow">
  <tr>
    <td>1-15</td><td>Philosophy</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>16-51</td><td>Religion</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>289-299</td><td>Law</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>333-561</td><td>Science</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>578-599</td><td>Industrial arts</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>600-681</td><td>Fine arts</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>682-999</td><td>Philology and literature</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>All books in the stacks are arranged according to
these classifications and shelf lists on cards are
available in the Catalogue Room. These are useful
because they show all books in a class whether
or not they happen to be on the shelves at any
one time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<h2>CATALOGUE</h2>

<p>The library card catalogue is filed in cases in
the east end of the Delivery Hall and is in two
parts.</p>

<p><b>The Main Catalogue</b> is a record of the works
in the library. It gives an entry under author,
under title, if distinctive or in case of periodicals,
and also under specific subject or subjects if the
books have been classified according to the Library
of Congress scheme. For example, James Allan’s
“Under the dragon flag” (reclassified) is entered
in the catalogue under Allan, James; by
title: Under the dragon flag; and by subject:
Chinese-Japanese war, 1894-1895. Thus there are
three avenues of approach, one for the reader who
knows the author’s name, another for the reader
who remembers the title, but cannot recall the
author, and a third for the reader who wishes
something on the Chinese-Japanese war and has
no definite book in mind. Books not classified by
the Library of Congress scheme but still under
the Rowell classification have the usual author
and distinctive title cards in the main catalogue,
but in place of a subject entry will be found a
reference from the subject to that number in the
classed subject catalogue where it will be found.
For example, Freu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>d’s “Interpretation of dreams”
appears in the main catalogue under Freud, Sigmund,
and under Interpretation of dreams; but
instead of appearing under the subject Dreams
there is a reference card under that word which
reads: Dreams, see subject catalogue under 11 <i>d.</i>
On turning to the subject catalogue at that number
the reader finds not only Freud’s book, but
all other books in the library on the subject of
dreams.</p>

<p><b>The Classed Subject Catalogue</b> occupies one
face of the two cases nearest the entrance to the
Reference Room and covers only the subjects still
under the Rowell classification. It is a numerical
arrangement of the cards in the order in which
the books stand on the shelves i.e., all cards on
a given subject are grouped together under one
number. Indexes in book form referring from
subject to number are to be found on the tables
reserved for consulting the catalogue.</p>

<p>The reader wishing books on meteors, for
example, finds in the index opposite the word
meteors the number 369. He turns to the classed
subject catalogue at that number and sees there
the library’s resources on that subject. He will
also find in the main catalogue under the word
meteors, a reference card: Meteors, see subject
catalogue under 369. So whether he consults the
printed index or the main catalogue, he will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
referred to the same place in the classed subject
catalogue.</p>

<p><b>The Call Number</b> (which indicates the classification
and the shelf location of the book) is in
the upper left hand corner of the catalogue card.
It must be exactly copied in the corresponding
place on the call slip to enable an attendant to
find the book.</p>

<p><b>Removal Slips.</b>&mdash;For various reasons it is frequently
necessary to remove cards from the catalogue.
When this is done a colored removal slip
is placed in the catalogue bearing the author’s
name, title, and call number, and the initials of
the assistant who has the card. This does not
indicate that the book is off the shelf. It may as
readily be obtained by copying the call number,
author and title from the removal slip, as from
the original card.</p>

<p>In the process of reclassification, it is necessary
to remove the books from the shelves and
the cards from the catalogue. When this is done,
a card stamped <span class="smcap">Reclassification</span>, bearing the
author’s name and the title of the book, is filed
in the place of the author card removed. If the
book is desired by a reader, it must be requested
at the Loan Desk with the statement that the
card is marked <span class="smcap">Reclassification</span>.</p>

<p>When difficulty is found in using the catalogues<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
or in locating references to material supposedly in
the library, inquiry should always be made at the
Reference Department.</p>

<p><b>Other Library Catalogues.</b>&mdash;The catalogues of
other large libraries form important bibliographic
aids. The following are available in this library:</p>

<p>The Union Depository Catalogue, filed in cases
in the south corridor, main floor; this includes
author cards for the books in the Library of Congress,
various government departmental libraries
in Washington, D.C., and such cards as have been
printed by the John Crerar Library, Harvard University,
University of Chicago, University of
Illinois, University of Michigan, and Newberry
libraries.</p>

<p>In the Catalogue Room will also be found certain
printed catalogues in book form, chief among
which are those of the British Museum, Bibliothèque
Nationale, Boston Athenaeum, London
Library, Peabody Institute Library, and Surgeon
General’s Library. These may be consulted in
the Catalogue Room between 9 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span> and 5 <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span>
At other hours apply to the Reference Department.</p>

<h2>THE BOOK STACK</h2>

<p>Members of the faculty have free access to the
stack. Permits are required of all others. Card
for stack permit may be obtained at the Loan Desk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
by a graduate student and should be filled out
and signed by his instructor before being presented
to the Associate Librarian for approval.
Though undergraduates presenting a reasonable
request at the Reference Desk will be given an
opportunity to look over the literature of any
particular subject, permits for any length of time
will only be issued in exceptional cases for, in
general, undergraduate needs are met by the Reading
Room and Reserved Book collections.</p>

<p>As far as possible books are arranged on the
nine floors of the stack in proper classification
sequence, but as convenience of access has caused
some exceptions, a guide is posted on the central
case as one enters the stack on the main floor.
More detailed charts will be found on each floor.</p>

<h2>CIRCULATION DEPARTMENT</h2>

<p><b>To call for a book not on open shelves.</b>&mdash;As it
has been found impossible to allow free access to
the stack, it is necessary to apply for books at
the Loan Desk. The procedure in drawing a book
is as follows:</p>

<p>A call slip when properly filled out, giving call
number, author, title, name and address of the
borrower, should be presented at the east end of
the Loan Desk. An attendant at the desk will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
procure the book from the stack or make a report
as to its location.</p>

<p>If the book is to be used in the library a
white “Library Use Slip” should be filled out;
if for home use a manila “Home Use Slip” is
required. This distinction is important for a book
taken out on a Library Use Slip is overdue if not
returned the day issued. A reader must return
books drawn on the Library Use Slip to the Loan
Desk before leaving the library. He will be held
responsible for books drawn in his name so long
as his slips remain unclaimed.</p>

<p><b>To have a book held.</b>&mdash;A book which is on loan
and is desired by another reader will be reserved
on its return if request is made. The inquirer
will be given a postcard which should be filled out
and left with a loan desk attendant. When the
book is returned this card will be mailed notifying
the inquirer that the book will be held four
days.</p>

<p><b>To renew a book.</b>&mdash;A book may be renewed if
not in demand by another reader and if request
for renewal is made before it becomes overdue.
To renew a book it is necessary to give the attendant
at the Loan Desk either the book or the call
number and the name of the person to whom the
book is charged. Wait until the attendant reports
whether or not the book can be renewed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Misunderstandings occur because a book cannot
be renewed and the borrower has left without
waiting to get this report. A renewal may be
made by mail or by telephone but there is less
chance of error when the borrower calls in person.
A book which is overdue will not be renewed
and cannot be drawn out again by the
same person until the following day.</p>

<h2>RESERVED BOOK ROOM</h2>

<p>Books selected by members of the faculty as
assigned readings for their students are known
as reserved books and are shelved in the Reserved
Book Room on the ground floor of the library, to
the right of the main entrance. They are grouped
on the reserve shelves according to courses of
instruction and a list giving the name of the
course and the number of the case where the
books for that course are shelved is posted on the
bulletin board.</p>

<p>An alphabetic author catalogue of the books
on reserve, giving their location by case and
shelf, is on file just inside the entrance. If the
desired book is not readily found on the shelves,
consult this, for occasionally the same book is
wanted for more than one course, or there are
copies of the same title in different reserves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
When class references are given try this catalogue
before asking at the Loan Desk.</p>

<p>The books forming the History 1 collection are
arranged in call number order in cases 14 to 92.
There is a separate card catalogue giving a list
of these books and their call numbers also a chart
to aid in locating the book by the call number.</p>

<p>To draw a book from the room go through the
turnstile, select the book, copy author’s name,
short title, and the call number as it appears on
the back of the book. Sign name and address,
and present slip and book to the attendant at
exit.</p>

<p>Readers are requested not to take books or
handbags into the enclosure. They should also
note that while books may be carried from this
room to other parts of the library, excepting for
overnight charges, they are issued only for use in
the building and should be returned as soon as
continuous reading is over. They should not be
passed on to other readers or left out of use on
some shelf or table while the borrower is away
at class or meals. To allow most equitable use of
these books readers may have only one out at a
time, but a dictionary or atlas may be taken in
addition.</p>

<p>Before leaving the library, return to the discharging
desk in the Reserved Book Room all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
books drawn out, and reclaim and destroy slips.
Readers who do not care to wait for call slips
may leave books on the return desk or drop them
in the slot cut in it, but as they are responsible
for books as long as their slips remain on file,
reclaiming them insures against possible error.</p>

<p>For the rules and regulations regarding library
and home use of books and for the penalties prescribed
for failure to observe them, reference
should be made to <a href="#Page_29">pages 29-36</a> of this handbook.</p>

<h2>INTER-LIBRARY LOANS</h2>

<p>The resources of the library are supplemented
by borrowing from other libraries books not
readily obtainable by purchase. The individual
in whose behalf a loan is solicited pays all transportation
charges and undertakes to conform to
the conditions of use made by the lending library.
This library also lends many books to other
libraries. Individuals living some distance from
Berkeley should request loans through their local
libraries. As this library is primarily for the use
of the university faculty and students, applications
for loans by other libraries should be restricted
to books difficult to obtain by purchase
and not available in a nearer library. All requests
for inter-library loans should be made to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the Librarian, who alone is authorized to lend
books to other libraries or borrow from them.</p>

<h2>SPECIAL COLLECTIONS</h2>

<p>The few special collections of this library are
housed in separate rooms and the books in them
are restricted to use in the building.</p>

<p><b>The Archives Room</b> on the mezzanine floor over
the Reference Room is open only to those having
the permission of the Librarian; others needing
material kept there should apply for it at the
Reference Desk. Very complete files of faculty
and student publications and all available material
illustrating the history of the University are
shelved in this room.</p>

<p><b>California literature</b> has for many years been
made the object of a special collection, and several
hundred volumes of poetry, drama, and general
literature by Californians will be found shelved
in the book stack under nos. 984-985. The portion
of the collection classified as fiction (986) is
separately shelved in room 320 and is not for
general use. To consult the fiction a special permit
must be obtained from the Librarian who will
consider only applicants doing serious work in
that field.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p><b>California and Pacific Coast history collections</b>
will be found in the Bancroft Library, on the
ground floor to the left of the main entrance.
This, the most complete collection of material in
its field, is under separate administration and for
the most part its books are not included in the
General Library catalogue.</p>

<p><b>The Chinese collection</b>, about 3600 individual
works, shelved in room 425, is the gift of Mr. S.
C. Kiang, whose family for generations had been
gathering together this library of Chinese literature.
A card catalogue of the contents will be
found in the room. Students in Chinese also have
access to the private collection of Professor
Emeritus John Fryer, who has very kindly shelved
his Chinese library in room 416 and made it available
to scholars.</p>

<p><b>The Library of French Thought</b>, to be found in
room 303, was presented to the University by the
French Government through The Friends of
France. The titles were selected by professors
of the Sorbonne as the leading contributions of
French writers in all fields of knowledge. It consists
of about 2500 volumes and originally formed
part of the French exhibit at the Panama-Pacific
International Exposition.</p>

<p><b>The Karl Weinhold Library</b>, presented to the
University by John D. Spreckels, is now in seminar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
113. It was the private library of the late Professor
Weinhold of the University of Berlin, who
had gathered together in it over 6000 volumes and
more than 2000 pamphlets devoted to Germanic
language, literature, folklore, and antiquities.
The original editions of works of literature in
which it is especially rich are listed in Library
Bulletin 16.</p>

<h2>SEMINAR ROOMS</h2>

<p>These rooms are for the exclusive use of faculty
and students of the departments to which
they are assigned. Keys may be obtained at the
Reference Desk but will be issued only to those
who secure an application card, have it approved
by a professor or instructor holding classes in the
room, and make a deposit of one dollar with the
University Cashier. Keys to table drawers may
also be obtained on additional deposit of one dollar
per key. No exemption from key deposit will
be made to any but those holding Regents’ appointments.
Reference should be made to <a href="#Page_33">page

<h2>DEPARTMENTAL LIBRARIES</h2>

<p>The University Library comprises not only the
General Library, but also a large number of departmental
libraries, seventeen on the campus,
five in other parts of the state. They are under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
the control of the departments, who set the hours
and conditions of their use, and therefore applicants
for their books should go direct to them.
They are for the most part made up of books purchased
on departmental budgets, supplemented in
some cases by deposits from the General Library.
All books are purchased through the General Library
and in the case of campus departments they
are all included in the main catalogue with an
indication of the department in which they will
be found in the place of the usual call number.
For those departments outside of Berkeley only
such books as cannot be found on the campus are
included in the public catalogue, but a shelf list
of all books in each library is in the Catalogue
Room.</p>

<h2>THE REFERENCE DEPARTMENT</h2>

<p>The Reference Desk faces the east end of the
Delivery Hall, between the Reading Room and the
Periodical Room. The function of the department
is to give assistance to readers in their search for
information or for books. Readers should apply
here for aid in the use of the catalogue or for
direction in finding the resources of the library
upon any subject under investigation. The Reference
Department has supervision over reference
books, periodicals, maps, United States government
documents, university archives and publications,
and the “New Books” shelf.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Reading Room Collection.</b>&mdash;Reference books are
shelved in the Reading Room. Dictionaries, encyclopaedias,
yearbooks, indexes, and bibliographies
will be found in the two floor cases (A and
B) directly back of the center desk. The collection
of atlases will be found in the atlas case (C).
Other works of reference, together with a collection
of general literature, are arranged by subjects
in the wall cases around the room. Those
reclassified by the Library of Congress system
begin with case 1 to the left as one enters, and
the books arranged by the Rowell classification
follow them. The Mary Lake collection of English
and American literature occupies cases 112 to 116.</p>

<p><b>Periodicals.</b>&mdash;The library receives approximately
8000 serials. The current numbers of 1200
of these are placed on the shelves around the
Periodical Room and in the adjoining stack.
These periodicals are grouped by subjects. The
general magazines are in cases 1 to 4, art journals
in case 5, etc. A directory of the location
of subjects will be found on the bulletin board.
A collection of the 296 sets of bound periodicals
most frequently called for is shelved in alphabetical
order in the adjoining stack room or
Annex, to which readers have free access.</p>

<p>Recent issues of newspapers are filed in the
Annex. The General Library does not subscribe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
to California papers as they fall within the field
of the Bancroft Library.</p>

<p>The general indexes to periodical literature,
such as Poole’s Index, The Readers’ Guide, Magazine
Subject Index, and the Book Review Digest
are shelved in cases 77 to 79 at the right of the
entrance to the Periodical Room. Instruction in
the use of these will be given to any applicant
at the Reference Desk.</p>

<p>Periodicals are not to be taken from the room.
The rules governing their circulation and use will
be found on <a href="#Page_30">page 30-36</a> of this handbook.</p>

<p><b>United States Government Publications.</b>&mdash;The
library is a depository for the publications of the
United States government. The bound volumes
are catalogued and shelved in the stack with
other books on the same subject. Unbound publications
are recorded at the Reference Desk and
may be consulted by applying there.</p>

<p>Indexes to the United States documents, covering
the period from the formation of the government
to the present time, will be found in case
76, at the right of the entrance to the Periodical
Room.</p>

<p><b>Maps.</b>&mdash;The map collection is located in the
Map Room (318). The United States topographic
and coast and geodetic survey maps, a selection
of the United States hydrographic maps and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
of those of the British general staff, together
with the maps of the principal countries of the
world, the states of the United States, and the
counties of California make up the greater part
of the collection. A card catalogue of all maps
in the Map Room has been compiled and serves
as a geographic index to the collection. To use
this catalogue or to see maps apply to the Reference
Department.</p>

<p><b>University Publications.</b>&mdash;The library receives
many publications of other universities. Catalogues,
administrative reports, theses, department
and student publications come unbound. These
are recorded in the serial record and are filed
alphabetically under the name of the university
on the first floor of the stack. A collection of
the latest catalogues of the larger American universities
is kept at the Reference Desk.</p>

<p><b>New Books.</b>&mdash;New books added to the library
before going to their regular places in the stack
are displayed on shelves back of the Reference
Desk. These books are placed there on Monday
and are on exhibition for one week. Readers may
reserve new books for home use by making out a
“Home Use Slip” and filing it at the Reference
Desk. Such books will be held at the Loan Desk
for three days following the succeeding Monday.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<h2>ACCESSIONS DEPARTMENT</h2>

<p>This department has charge of the purchasing
of all books and periodicals required in any part
of the University. It also looks after the building
up of the General Library collection by exchange
and gift and the binding of all General
Library books and magazines.</p>

<p>On the shelves of its office, on the western side
of the main floor, will be found a good working
collection of the trade catalogues and national
and other bibliographies most used in the identification
and ordering of books in English or in the
chief languages of continental Europe. Files of
recent second hand catalogues are also kept arranged
by subject. All these may be used in the
Accessions Boom between 9 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span> and 5 <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span> and
when it is closed they may be had on call from
the Reference Department.</p>

<p>The card records for book orders kept by this
department include those outstanding, those in
process (that is for books which have been received
but may not yet be catalogued), filled
orders for the last fifteen years and orders cancelled
because books were not obtainable. Separately
kept periodical, exchange and gift records
show what numbers of any serial were received
and their present location in the library.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>Copies of all order sheets are filed in binders
by department and from them it can readily be
shown what books have been received and their
cost, as well as those still outstanding and the
lien on the fund made on their account. Periodicals
and other continuations which form additional
yearly liens on book funds are also listed
in the order files, so statements of the condition
of any General Library book fund can always be
furnished on request.</p>

<p>This department has charge of the General
Library binding which is done at the University
Printing Office, but for periodicals being held for
binding call should be made at the Reference
Department. Records of those at the bindery are
also kept there.</p>

<p>The General Library book fund is distributed
by the Library Committee early in the autumn
term and full details of the allotment are to be
found in the printed report sent regularly to all
members of the Academic Senate. Orders for
books and subscriptions to new periodicals should
be made on the order cards furnished by the
library and should be signed by the head of the
department or such members as have the authority
of the department to do so. They must be
filled out with approximately correct date as to
place, publisher, and date of publication and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
should be checked with the catalogue before being
handed in. When notification of the receipt of a
book is desired both parts of the special double
card must be filled out; merely to sign the second
half is not sufficient. As a large purchaser the
library buys in the cheapest markets and ships
by freight, therefore under normal conditions
current American books take at least six weeks
and European importations four months to reach
Berkeley. Cards for books needed at once should
be marked “Rush” so that they may be obtained
close at hand or secured by express, but it should
be noted that anticipation of needs will aid the
department book funds, for postage or expressage
on rush books is made a part of the cost of such
books.</p>

<p>When books are already here or on order the
cards will be annotated with the call number,
“in process,” or “on order” and returned to
the person who asked for them. Additional copies
will only be purchased on special request and not
more than two copies in all can be bought from
General Library funds. Books or magazines for
departmental libraries are ordered in the usual
way through the library, but must be paid for
from the departmental budget, and to avoid misunderstanding
the fund should be indicated under
the proper heading. Suggestions as to desirable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
material to be obtained by gift or exchange will
always be welcome. Suggestions for purchase of
books of general interest should be sent to the
Associate Librarian, but material dealing with any
subject of instruction or investigation recognized
by the University should be brought to the attention
of the head of the department most interested.</p>

the room where shelved. They may, however, be
borrowed overnight subject to the usual procedure
and regulations covering such charges. Students<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
must have written permission of the professor or
instructor who placed book in seminar to borrow
it for longer than over night. All books, whether
borrowed by faculty or students, must be regularly
charged at the Loan Desk.</p>

<p>4. The use of the seminar rooms is restricted
to professors and instructors and to students for
whom the privilege has been requested by them.
Unauthorized persons must not be admitted by
students. Seminar room doors must not be left
open, excepting when classes are being held in
the rooms.</p>

<p>5. Seminar rooms must be vacated by students
when the library is closed. Closing hour
week days is 10 <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span>; Sundays and vacation
periods, 5 <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span></p>

<p>Students failing to comply with the above
seminar regulations are liable to forfeit seminar
privileges.</p>

<h3 class="left">VII. Library Fines and Penalties.</h3>

<p>Fines on overdue books are not for the purpose
of revenue. Indeed, they do not accrue to
the funds of the library, but they have been
proved necessary to obtain observance of the
regulations made to protect the rights of all
readers.</p>

<p>1. On reserved books drawn on white slips and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
not returned to the discharging desk in the Reserved
Book Room on the day on which drawn
(or within the time limit if issued for a limited
period) the fine is 50 cents a volume; this will be
doubled on all books not returned before noon of
the following day.</p>

<p>2. On books or periodicals drawn on pink overnight
slips and not returned to the desk from
which drawn twenty minutes after the opening
hour the following day the fine is 50 cents a
volume; this will be doubled on all books or
periodicals not returned before noon.</p>

<p>3. On all other books and periodicals which
become overdue the fine is 50 cents per volume if
not returned on or before the third day overdue,
increasing to $1.00 per volume after the sixth
day. On the tenth day the case will be referred
to the Recorder and the delinquent is liable to be
dropped from the rolls of the University. Failure
to receive overdue notices does not relieve from
penalty, for the date due is stamped in each book.</p>

<p>4. Readers are responsible for books drawn by
them so long as their call slips remain unclaimed.
Fines resulting from carelessness in this regard
will not be remitted. Books merely left at the
desk will be considered returned when found by
a library attendant. Loss or misplacement of
books or periodicals should be at once reported<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
and adjustment made, otherwise fines will be
assessed as above on borrower charged with them.</p>

<p>5. Any person who marks, damages, or loses
any library book or periodical shall be required
to replace it by a new copy. If the volume is
one of a set the loser becomes responsible for the
perfecting of the set and if the book is out of print
he will have to pay the current price of the book
as far as it can be ascertained.</p>

<p>6. Any wilful damage to library furniture,
equipment, or building will be repaired at the
expense of the responsible person.</p>

<p>7. Any borrower for wilful or continuous violation
of library regulations may be debarred by
the Librarians from library privileges for the remainder
of the current semester and for such
other specified term as the President may direct.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
